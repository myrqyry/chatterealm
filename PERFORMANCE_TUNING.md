# Performance Tuning Guide

This guide provides strategies for optimizing the performance of the biome rendering system.

## Key Performance Metrics

- **Frame Rate (FPS)**: The number of frames rendered per second. Aim for a consistent 60 FPS for a smooth user experience.
- **Frame Time**: The time it takes to render a single frame. This should be kept below 16ms to achieve 60 FPS.
- **Memory Usage**: The amount of memory used by the application. This should be monitored to prevent memory leaks and ensure the application runs smoothly on a variety of devices.

## Optimization Strategies

- **Viewport Culling**: The `ViewportCuller` utility can be used to cull biomes and other game objects that are outside the current viewport. This is the most effective way to improve rendering performance.
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: The `BiomeTextureService` includes a simple LOD system that reduces the detail of textures that are far from the camera. This can be extended to other game objects to further improve performance.
- **Polygon Simplification**: The `BoundaryTracer` uses the `simplify-js` library to simplify the polygons that represent biome boundaries. This can significantly reduce the number of vertices that need to be rendered, improving performance.
- **Render Call Batching**: The `RenderCoordinator` can be optimized to batch render calls for similar objects. This can reduce the number of state changes and improve performance.
- **Performance Profiling**: The `RenderingProfiler` utility can be used to identify performance bottlenecks. This information can then be used to target optimization efforts.
