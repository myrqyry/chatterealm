# Rough Fill Artistic Guide

This guide provides artistic guidelines for designing biomes with a cohesive, hand-drawn aesthetic using `rough.js`.

## Principles

- **Embrace Imperfection**: The core of the hand-drawn style is imperfection. Avoid perfectly straight lines and uniform patterns. Use `roughness` and `bowing` to create organic, natural-looking shapes.
- **Cohesive Color Palettes**: Each biome should have a distinct and harmonious color palette. Use the `primary`, `secondary`, and `border` colors to create depth and visual interest.
- **Meaningful Textures**: Textures should be used to convey information about the biome. For example, `hachure` can be used to represent dense forests, while `dots` can be used for sandy deserts.
- **Subtle Animations**: Animations should be used to bring the world to life, but they should be subtle and not distracting. Use the `animationProperties` to create gentle breathing and pulsing effects.

## Best Practices

- **Start with a Concept**: Before you start designing, have a clear concept for the biome. What is its story? What kind of mood do you want to evoke?
- **Iterate and Refine**: Don't be afraid to experiment. Try different combinations of `rough.js` settings until you find the perfect look for your biome.
- **Test in Context**: Always test your biomes in the context of the game world. Make sure they look good next to other biomes and that they are visually distinct.
